    <p><strong>Question-1: </strong>what is the difference between local storage & storage?</p>

        cleared when the page session ends.</p>

    <p><strong>Question-2: </strong>difference between global scope and block scope in javascript?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in
        Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
        statements, and the like.</p>

    <p><strong>Question-3: </strong>how javascript event loop works?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If
        the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
        Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
